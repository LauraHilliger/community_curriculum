##Participate: Building our Culture

Co-design, networked learning, playtesting and feedback--we invite others to participate in everything we do. As mentors, it’s our responsibility to invite others to learn with us. 

Mozilla, P2PU, Wikipedia, YouTube, and Instructables are all cultures of participation. As a network, we can solve large-scale, unique, complicated and new problems together. We can be socially creative, inspire each other and overcome obstacles.

By inviting others to participate, they climb the first rung of the “<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/Engagement_Ladder">ladder of engagement</a>.” In our online communities, we all participate at different levels of passion and experience. Scholar Gerard Fischer, in his study of online communities, shows how participation evolves:

We all entered this community at different levels of engagement. For example, you might have started out as a learner at a Maker Party or in the last iteration of #TeachTheWeb. Then you might have shared a remix or make with the wider Mozilla community and found it retweeted and shared again by the #TeachTheWeb team. After that, maybe you taught a few colleagues some basic HTML for a class project or held a small maker party to remix a starter resource. As you increased the frequency and depth of your involvement with Mozilla, the Mozilla community increased its engagement with you.

Together, are building our own community of mentors. How can you continue to be a part of the contribution ladder, leveling up your own skills and contributions as you reach out to help others along the ladder, as well?

Just as we work to design purposeful, participatory, and fun events for learners, we need to remain connected with one another up and down the contribution ladder in purposeful, participatory, and fun ways. In thinking about how to connect further with others working for an open Web, and in thinking about how to help others begin this work, as well, you might:

- Learn <a href="https://github.com/LauraHilliger/community_curriculum">GitHub</a> and post your curriculum (for makes AND events) there, for developers and educators to 'fork' into their own work.
- Talk with local educators in formal spaces - like schools and libraries - about starting a <a href="http://teach.webmaker.org/clubs">Webmaker club</a> with an institutional co-sponsor.
- Level-up another local contributor to mentor status and work together to scale up your events from the kitchen table to larger venues like maker spaces or libraries.
- Push your work into a new place for new audiences - run a <a href="https://training.webmakerprototypes.org/en/host-a-training/">live session</a> using Together.js, write an e-book on coding in the classroom or learn how to make an online or print-and-play game that teaches the web.

**Ultimately, we connect with one another to make this work real.** An open Web depends on open societies, and those societies are full of living, breathing people like us who can best latch on to ideas of diversity and freedom when given the chance to see and make things of tangible worth and personal meaning like any number of Webmaker and open source projects around the world. Connecting at a human level, face-to-face and online, low-fi and hi-fi, to help and ask for help - this is what it means to stay connected in an effort to write the Open Web and open societies.

We’ve put [theory] (http://training.webmakerprototypes.org/en/exploring/concepts/) and [practice] (http://training.webmakerprototypes.org/en/facilitating/concepts/) to the test and seen first hand that shifting dynamic of mentor/learner relationships. It’s time to help each other as we create local communities of practice that tie into a global movement.

###To recap:
* We are building our own participatory culture in our Webmaker mentor community
* Together we can solve large-scale, complex problems
* You can continue to level up through teaching yourself new things, asking others to participate, and sharing your successes and lessons learned
